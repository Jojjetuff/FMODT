After discontinuing the maintaining of my Version of Scammers Scorpion Trainer, I wanted to create something new.

After checking MrDaGrees GUI Management out I liked it and used it as a new base to work with. Once again, thank you MrDaGree for providing such a helpful resource.

After some time I created a new Trainer, called CHEM!CAL T0Ð–!N.

It has some helpful features and also some special features I will mention further down.
Currently it is kinda in a beta phase. It is not finished now but usable.

MrDaGrees GUI Management: https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-gui-management-maker-mod-menu-style-menus-uhh-ya/29371

You can find more Screenshots of the Menu here: https://imgur.com/a/hembn

If you want to help me translating the Menu, check this Thread out: https://forum.fivem.net/t/chem-cal-t0-n-in-need-of-translators/48180

To open the Menu with the Keyboard press the INPUT_SELECT_CHARACTER_MICHAEL, by default F5

To open the Menu with the Gamepad press RB/ R1 + X/ SQUARE.

Check the config.lua to change some Settings.
